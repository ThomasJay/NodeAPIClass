# NodeAPIClass

Node API Class I published on Udemy.com

This Repository is broken down into two sections, the First is the initial API design creating the "Thngs" end points.

The Second is creating the "Users" end points with the GeoSpatian / Location Searches.

You will need Node.js 4.x, Express 4.x and MongoDB 3.2 or higher.

I developed these API's on a Mac OSX El Capitan.

Hope you enjoy the class and look at my other API and IoT classes on Udemy.
